Running the test suite:
There are test files corresponding to each class in our social network program. Our catch2 equivalent in python is the Unit Testing Framework that is part of the Python Documentation below:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

To run the test suite files:
Run the respective python files using the "Run Python Button" in your respective IDE (Preferrably VSCode) or you may type the following in the command line:
python -m unittest test_something.py

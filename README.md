Hello, this is the final project for CS128.

The proposed project will include creating a node-based social network on the Web using flask where *users* are connected by their *friend* relationship (friend class. A *user* will need to have at least one *friend* in the *network.* They will sign up with their given *opinions* on *categories* and be connected to a friend randomly to start off with. They will also have the option of adding/removing *friends* and interacting within the *network.* The *network* will enable *users* to be exposed to new *items* in a given *category* based on what other *users* in the *network* enjoy. We made our project using python. Our goal is to suggest new items from categories using the interests of the friends and friends of friends of the user node. 

How to Build Our Project:
Use a development environment like VSCode and make sure to install python from the link below:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

After copying the repository, setting up an IDE to run the program, and installing python you are almost ready to begin!

The following libraries are utilized and must therefore be installed:
1: First install pip so that these libraries can easily be insatlled
2: pip3 install sqlite3
3: pip3 install matplotlib
4: pip3 install networkx

To start, sign up on our website to place your opinions into a database used for our social network. These opinions of items in specific categories will help us recommend more items from these categories and find others with similar interests. 

Running the test suite:
There are test files corresponding to each class in our social network program. Our catch2 equivalent in python is the Unit Testing Framework that is part of the Python Documentation below:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

To run the test suite files:
Run the respective python files using the "Run Python Button" in your respective IDE (Preferrably VSCode) or you may type the following in the command line:
python -m unittest test_something.py
